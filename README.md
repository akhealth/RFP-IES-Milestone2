## Important note about referenced documentation

You'll notice that we link to a number of working documents in our RFP and related materials.  Interested vendors should be aware that all of these documents are subject to change because Alaska is continuing to learn more as we continue prototyping and working with various elements of the existing system to build out our DevSecOps capabilities.  In addition to paying close attention to this repository, we encourage interested vendors to "Watch" what's going on in [the DPA Eligibility Modernization repo](https://github.com/akhealth/EIS-Modernization).  We don't anticipate anything that we learn or change in this environment to alter how an interested vendor would staff up their proposed teams.  As discussed throughout the RFP, we are interested in vendors that are open to such changes without requiring a static set of requirements at the time of the RFP.

### How to respond or ask questions

We've made every effort to allow for less burden in what we require from interested vendors.  Although the RFP might seem to be pretty extensive, we're asking for questions that will better enable us to clarify parts of this RFP that might be unclear. please use [the built in GitHub Q/A](https://github.com/akhealth/RFP-IES-Milestone2/issues/new/choose) to ask questions, make suggestions, or provide feedback. We intend to review feedback and make RFP amendments and updates as needed.

### Budget

We estimate a budget of XXXX dollars for the completion of this project as outlined in the RFP. Proposals priced at more than this amount will be considered non-responsive.  This will be a time and materials contract.

### Contract Term
