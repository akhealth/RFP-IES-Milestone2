#  Section 2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

## Sec. 2.01 Background Information

Alaska Statute
[47.05.010](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/statutes.asp#47.05.010)
designates Department of Health (DOH), Division of Public Assistance
(DPA) as having responsibility for determining eligibility and
administration of Alaska’s public assistance programs. As a part of this
designation, DPA is charged with determining eligibility for each of the
programs based on state and federal regulation, governed by Alaska
Administrative Code, [Title
7](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/aac.asp#1.05). Our mission is to “promote
self-sufficiency and provide basic living expenses to Alaskans in need.”

This includes the following programs:

- Adult Public Assistance (APA)
- Alaska Temporary Assistance Program (ATAP)
- ATAP Work Services (TANF)
- Childcare Assistance
- Chronic and Acute Medical Assistance (CAMA)
- Family Nutrition
- General Relief Assistance
- Heating Assistance
- Interim Assistance
- Medicaid
  - Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)
  - Denali KidCare (SCHIP)
  - Aged, Disabled, Blind, and Long-Term Care
- Permanent Fund Dividend Hold-Harmless
- Senior Benefits
- Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (aka food stamps)
- SNAP Employment and Training
- Tribal TANF
- Women, Infants, and Children Program (WIC)

DPA has federal partners, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS), Food and Nutrition Services (FNS), and Administration of
Children and Families (ACF), who we work with to implement regulations
and program rules.

To perform this work, DPA uses several technical systems. These include
a legacy mainframe system (EIS), as well as a modern Modified Adjusted
Gross Income (MAGI) Medicaid determination platform, known as Alaska's
Resource for Integrated Eligibility Services (ARIES).

While EIS has effectively supported program administration and benefit
delivery for over 40 years, the technology on which it is based (IBM
mainframe platform, COBOL software development language and ADABAS
database management system) is becoming increasingly difficult to
maintain. Many significant changes in Public Assistance programs and
program administration have occurred since the system was placed into
production in 1984. Mandatory Federal Medicaid provisions of the ACA,
Welfare Reform, new program demands, and the continued growth and
complexity in public assistance programs are creating a shift in
business needs. The system is currently functioning well beyond the
capacity for which it was designed and does not provide the flexibility
needed to implement mandatory federal provisions.

The modern system, called ARIES, is used by over 400 users consisting of
eligibility technicians, administrative staff, and management personnel
within DPA, and contains over 200,000 benefit recipients. In addition to
these users there are multiple contractors and community partners that
access the system to assist in the public assistance program
administration. In total the ARIES system is used by over 700 users.

Greater system flexibility and robust reporting capabilities are needed
to accommodate changes driven by federal and state laws and to ensure
the long-term ability of DPA to provide efficient, economical, and
effective administration of its programs. The Division needs to pursue
implementation of a more advanced software application based on current
technology and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that aligns with the
Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) and compliance with
the CMS Seven Standards and Conditions. This will ensure a successful
implementation of the mandatory federal Medicaid provisions.

In addition, DPA needs a user-friendly and adaptable system to gain
efficiencies, reduce system maintenance costs, respond to increasing
service demands, improve customer service, and better support the
timeliness and accuracy of eligibility decisions.

DPA is developing a modern, integrated eligibility system that enables
staff to more efficiently issue correct and timely benefits to Alaskans
who need help meeting their basic needs. Utilizing agile development
methods and modular procurements, DPA has the goal of implementing an
eligibility system that not only meets state and federal standards, but
is user friendly for clients, eligibility staff, and technical staff.

DPA has moved away from a "big bang" waterfall acquisitions process to a
more modular approach, emphasizing user centered design, agile product
development, and DevSecOps practices. We integrate user experience,
security, and privacy into all our development work. More information
about the Eligibility Modernization project can be found
[here](https://github.com/Akhealth/EIS-Modernization/) (**be sure to add
yourself as a watcher on the overall eligibility modernization
repository to automatically get updates about changes and upcoming
procurements**). The goal of this approach is to incrementally improve
the current situation in a measurable and sustainable way, and
eventually allow the continued migration of programs away from the
previous eligibility system and onto something more modern, flexible and
maintainable.

Offerors should review this repository for information that will be
critical in constructing a quality proposal.

[EIS Modernization Project Technical
Strategy](https://github.com/akhealth/EIS-Modernization/blob/master/tech-strategy.md)

This approach to ensuring continuing progress towards the DPA roadmap
goals is to organize product teams to work on the individual
procurements and product increments. These teams work together with the
selected vendor to complete work organized by regular sprints. These
sprints include activities like a daily or regular standup, a
retrospective held at the end of each sprint, a sprint review of work
completed, sprint planning and backlog grooming sessions.

The first product increments were improvements to the worker experience
in the ARIES System in addition to stabilizing the underlying
infrastructure (Milestone 1). In this acquisition, Milestone 2
Increments 1-5, we are looking to move the remaining Medicaid categories
off the legacy mainframe to a modern system exercising our user centered
design practices, modern software development methods and security
focused continuous deployment processes. Specific information regarding
this procurement can be found in the RFP-ARIES-Milestone 2 GitHub Repo

## Sec. 2.02 Medicaid Program Background Information

The Department of Health (DOH) is the state agency designated to
administer the Alaska Medicaid program, which includes:

- Medicaid
- Denali KidCare (DKC)
- Chronic and Acute Medical Assistance

The Division of Public Assistance (DPA) is responsible for determining
the eligibility of individuals and families in need of Medicaid
benefits.

DPA administers the Medicaid program in accordance with Federal and
State laws and regulations. The Medicaid program is authorized under
Title XIX and Title XXI of the Social Security Act and the Code of
Federal Regulations, Title 42 Part 435 and Title 45 Part 233. Alaska’s
Medicaid State Plan may be viewed
[here](https://health.alaska.gov/Commissioner/Pages/MedicaidStatePlan/default.aspx).

Alaska joined the Medicaid program in September 1972. New services and
eligible groups have been added to the program since that time by the
Legislature. The Medicaid program in Alaska is authorized under Alaska
Statutes 47.07.010 - 47.07.900 and the Alaska Administrative Code, Title
7 Chapter 43 and Chapter 100.

Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the state.
Certain groups of individuals and services are required by federal law,
while other optional groups of individuals and services are selected by
the State.

Medicaid benefits are a crucial component of the safety-net services
delivered through DPA. Careful assessment by DPA staff identifies the
Medicaid program best suited to meet the needs of applicant families and
individuals. As families transition from welfare to work, DPA staff
ensure that eligible family members continue to receive Transitional
Medicaid benefits. DPA staff is also responsible for determining
eligibility and issuing benefits for infants, children, pregnant women,
adults, elderly, and disabled individuals who qualify for one of the
categorical Medicaid programs.

The majority of Medicaid recipients are beneficiaries of other programs
and services administered and delivered by DPA. For example, many
recipients of ATAP benefits also receive Medicaid benefits. Many
children, young adults, and elderly or disabled persons receiving
Medicaid also receive SNAP or Adult Public Assistance benefits. Over
250,000 Alaskans receive medical benefits through the Medicaid Program.

**Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Medicaid**

In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law. The
ACA is based on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public
Law 111-148, as amended) and the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act (Public Law 111-152). The law as originally enacted
focuses on provisions to expand coverage, control health care costs, and
improve the health care delivery system. The ACA also included
provisions to streamline eligibility, enrollment, and renewal processes,
for example, by requiring a single application for Medicaid, CHIP, and
subsidized exchange coverage. The ACA changes for Medicaid came into
effect January 1, 2014, replacing Alaska’s Family Medicaid with MAGI
Medicaid.

The ACA established a new methodology for determining Medicaid income
eligibility for most children, pregnant women, parents, and adults. The
MAGI-based methodology considers taxable income and tax filing
relationships to determine financial eligibility for Medicaid. MAGI
replaced the former process for calculating Medicaid eligibility, which
was based on the methodologies of the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children program that ended in 1996. Some individuals are exempt from
the MAGI-based income counting rules, including those whose eligibility
is based on blindness, disability, or age (65 and older).

By allowing people seeking healthcare coverage to complete one
application that determined which health and social services programs
they or their family were eligible for, the Affordable Care Act made it
easier for people to apply for and enroll in health care coverage.

Eligibility determinations for MAGI Medicaid are made in ARIES. More

**Denali KidCare (DKC) aka State Children’s Health Insurance Program
(SCHIP)**

Denali KidCare provides excellent health insurance coverage for children
and teens through age 18, as well as for pregnant women who meet income
guidelines.

Eligibility determinations for Denali KidCare are made in ARIES.

**Adult Public Assistance (APA) and Long Term Care (LTC) Medicaid**

The applicable eligibility categories for APA and Long Term Care
Medicaid in Alaska are:
- Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Recipient
- APA Recipient
- SSI Eligible - Not Receiving Cash Payments
- APA Eligible - Not Receiving CashPayments
- SSI or APA Ineligibles for Reasons Prohibited by Medicaid
- Working Disabled Medicaid Buy-In
- Special Long Term Care
- Disabled Children at Home (TEFRA)
- “Pickle People” (Deemed an SSI)/APA recipient under the Pickle Amendment)
- “Section 1619(b)” Eligible
- SSI Disabled Children
- Disabled Widow(er)

Individuals receiving and are automatically eligible for Medicaid.

Individuals who meet the categorical requirements of APA-related
Medicaid but require an institutional living arrangement or home and
community-based care, may be eligible for Medicaid under the Special
Long Term Care category.

In addition, Alaska has the following eligibility categories that help
pay Medicare costs, but do not offer regular Medicaid coverage:

- Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB);
- Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWI);
- Specified Low Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB)
- Specified Low Income Medicare Beneficiary Plus (SLMB PLUS).
  
Eligibility determinations for APA and LTC related categories are
currently made in EIS. Milestone 2 Increments 1-5 plans to move these
categories from the legacy EIS to the modern integrated eligibility
system. More information may be found
[here](http://dpaweb.hss.state.ak.us/manuals/adltc/adltc.htm#t=title_page.htm).

**Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE)**

Hospital Presumptive Eligibility is a requirement of the Affordable Care
Act (ACA) that was effective January 1, 2014. States are required to
allow approved hospitals to presumptively determine eligibility for
certain categories of MAGI Medicaid and Breast & Cervical Cancer
Medicaid (BCCM / Ladies First).

## Sec. 2.03 Outcomes and Measurements

CMS-required outcomes for Medicaid Enterprise Systems (MES) are the
standard requirements for certification based on federal regulations and
statutes. These outcomes establish a baseline for the functionality of a
system or module, which is required to continue receiving federal
funding for operations. CMS-required outcomes also demonstrate that a
system complies with applicable federal regulations.

While some of the outcomes below have been achieved in the ARIES system
today, they must nonetheless remain a consideration for all future
development initiatives and/or system implementations. Specific metrics
have been defined for each of those outcomes; the DPA continues to
monitor those metrics seeking continual improvements. For those outcomes
below that have not yet been achieved, metrics will be developed to
facilitate measuring our success in achieving the related outcome.

**Eligibility Information System (EIS)**

EIS is an “Adaptable DAta BAse System” (ADABAS) database system which
resides in a mainframe environment. The database actually serves two
separate programs: EIS and the Case Management System (CMS).
Consequently, certain data files are shared between the systems.

EIS runs batch jobs to perform tasks in the following general
categories:
- Interface batch jobs
- Reports batch jobs
- Notices batch jobs
- Alerts batch jobs
- Issuance batch jobs
- Database Maintenance batch jobs and
- Other batch jobs
EIS interfaces with the following systems:
- Social Security Administration (SSA) Beneficiary Data Exchange (BENDEX)
- Department of Labor and Workforce Development (DOLWD)
- SSA Supplemental Security Income (SSI) / State Data Exchange (SDX)
- SSA State Verification Exchange System (SVES) / State On-Line Query (SOLQ)
- Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Income Eligibility Verification System (IEVS)
- Beneficiary Earnings Exchange Record System (BEERS)
- Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD)
- Alaska Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS)

- Other external website interfaces:
  - Ingens
  - SAVE - Automated Secondary Verification of Aliens' Status
- Other external applications:
  - Instant Eligibility Verification System (IEVS)
  - Current workflow management system
  - ILINX document management system

Integration:

The EIS mainframe environment is connected to two solutions for data
integration which can be used to interact with the mainframe / EIS data.

- SoftwareAG EntireX
  - Used primarily for searching EIS data using web services and an
    EntireX Broker
  - Limited Dataset
  - Read Only
- SoftwareAG CONNX
  - Support for syncing data to a Relational Database (RDBMS)
  - Support for various database adapters (licensed per adapter – current license for PostgreSQL)
  - All Data Available
  - Read / Write / Update / Delete
  - Supports creation of single views (data on mainframe / RDBMS)
  - Integration layer exists for certain data elements
	-Access is currently limited and this procurement would require additional APIs to be built to satisfy the data interoperability requirements

EIS supports benefit issuance through EBT, direct deposit, warrants,
standard and non-standard Medicaid coupons; Denali KidCare ID cards; and
Subsistence SNAP ID cards. ARIES supports benefit issuance through
standard and non-standard Medicaid cards and coupons and Denali KidCare
ID cards.

Both systems (EIS and ARIES) support notices and forms generation by
both data entry into the system and by other triggers such as dates or
specific case events. Generated notices are queued for nightly printing
and daily mailing at DPA Systems Support. Currently, notices and forms
support English as the only language. Notices are printed in a
standardized layout, font, color, etc., that may not be altered.

All notices include specific information printed on the back side of the
notice. System generated notices are automatically created when the case
is processed. Also, the creation of many system notices generates other
associated notices. These relationships are defined in each system.
Notices are also associated with particular forms (defined in the
system) to be included in the mailing. All forms are pre-printed and
exist in various sizes, colors, layout, etc.

# Section 3. SCOPE OF WORK & CONTRACT INFORMATION

## Sec. 3.01 Scope of Work

The Alaska Department of Health (DOH), Division of Public Assistance
(DPA), Eligibility Modernization Project Management Office (EMO), is
soliciting proposals for a software development and implementation
contractor.

The Department wants assistance in replacing an aging automated
eligibility information system (EIS) with a more efficient system that
will more effectively meet the changing needs of the State of Alaska.
Other key objectives include the following:
- Develop and deploy an Integrated Eligibility System (IES) or module
  that facilitates administering the following public assistance
  programs: Aged Blind and Disabled, Long Term Care, Waiver Medicaid,
  TEFRA, Additional Medicaid categories (Title IV-E, Residential
  Psychiatric Treatment, and MAGI-Spousal Support), and Hospital
  Presumptive Eligibility.
- Design and develop a new front-end portal, replacing the existing
  ARIES portal with a modern solution
- The system must integrate with ARIES, Genesys (call-center), ILINX
  (document management and e-Form(s) (public facing eligibility
  application)), Current (workflow management), Alaska Connect - Engage
  (client portal), IEVS (eligibility verification), etc.
  - Integration is intended to be performed via APIs that interact with
    the existing Azure integration services. These will need to be
    developed as a part of this procurement.
- System or module provides Alaska the flexibility to meet the
  challenges of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) including additional
  service integration with the Federal Data Services Hub;
- Develop and deploy a system or module that meets all current and
  applicable Federal guidelines, deadlines, and standards to include
  HIPAA, MITA 3.0, emerging standards and guidelines related to ACA, and
  compliance with the CMS Seven Standards & Conditions and Streamlined
  Modular Certification (SMC);
- Optimize application maintenance costs;
- Optimize long-term operational costs;
- Enhance program uniformity;
- Improve customer service;
- Allow for greater flexibility;
- Easy to use, maintain, and configure;
- Easy to expand system capabilities to support future requirements;
- Function based on a comprehensive, easily updateable rules engine.

The proposed solution will use existing state resources as much as
possible. Critical state resources include leveraging existing
technology and software licenses.

While the current modern eligibility platform (ARIES) is largely based
upon a Commercial Off-The Shelf (COTS) system, DPA will consider custom
development solutions and/or additional COTS solutions.

Additionally, we embrace the use of open-source software and may share
the code that is developed as part of this effort openly in public
repositories.

The successful offeror will build a new worker facing data entry
platform (portal) for all Medicaid categories to allow State of Alaska
DPA eligibility staff to enter information required, and to receive
eligibility determination information. This system will integrate with
the existing infrastructure listed in Section 2.04 including:

- Existing IBM components
  - Base WAS – WebSphere Application Server
  - Network Deployment WAS – WebSphere Application Server
  - Operational Decision Management – ODM
  - IBM Security Verify Access Appliance – ISVA
- Existing eligibility platform applications/components
  - Unified search module
  - JAVA
  - Spring framework
  - MuleSoft community edition ESB
  - Azure Integration Services (preferred over MuleSoft)
  - Quartz Enterprise Job Scheduler

    considering migrating to a new enterprise content management system
    (ECM))
  - Postgres (primary application database)
  - Atlassian JIRA for issue tracking
  - Azure DevOps
  - Aha! For road mapping and deployment plans
  - Modern Requirements (tracking testing activities)
  - Microsoft SQL and Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services – SSRS

The resulting system must also integrate with the components above to
meet the key objectives, all CMS required outcomes in Section 2.03 and
comply with the requirements in the attached QAP.

The goal of this project is to:
- Issue Medicaid program benefits based on program rules in accordance
  with all state and federal regulations and timeframes
- Support automated notice generation
  - All required correspondence and notices for program communication
    must be developed and integrated with existing enterprise content
    management system (ECM), currently OpenText ExStream but may change
    during the life of this contract.
- Benefit issuance based on program rules that follows all state and
  federal regulations.
- API layer that supports greater integration with existing systems and
  new systems, including client portal, document management, and
  workflow management systems
- Interconnections to all existing Federal and State data sources
- Greater integration with the legacy EIS, ARIES, Genesys (call-center),
  ILINX (document management), Current (task management and workflow
  management), Alaska Connect - Engage (client portal), IEVS
  (eligibility verification), etc.
  - This integration is planned to be accomplished via the Azure
    integration services in place, as well as CONNX and EntireX

artifacts, and create new user stories based on each sprint.

We typically house documentation in Azure DevOps either in the built-in
wiki, or as part of a repository. This allows the documents to be
versioned and controlled. DOH, DPA expects that the selected contractor
will create and update documentation using these standards where
appropriate.

**QUALITY ASSURANCE**

The contractor shall comply with the acceptable quality levels (AQL) as
described in the attached [quality assurance plan
(QAP)](https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/RFP-ARIES-AutomatedRenewals/blob/main/Attachment%2009%20QAP.md).

## Sec. 3.05 HIPAA Security Assessment Requirements

**Once the contract is executed and prior to beginning any other work
under the contract,** the contractor shall work with the Department of
Health (DOH) Security Office to ensure that any staff who will be
assigned to the project meet all required security clearance and
training processes outlined by DOH, SOA, and CMS. This includes
credentialing and training required of all staff who may have access to
PII or PHI as a part of this work. This process and the information
required of the contractor is detailed in a NIST CSF Assessment
Questions List (see next RFP section). Throughout the life of this
contract, the awarded vendor will work with the DOH and SOA security
offices to ensure that any staff added or removed from the team are

For DOH IT Security purposes, any conflict between these requirements
and the BAA, the ISA supersedes the BAA.

## Sec. 3.08 Information Technology (IT) Related Contractual Requirements

Other specific DOH IT-related contractual requirements are provided in
Attachment 2. The offeror must complete this spreadsheet in accordance
with the provided instructions; space is provided to provide both choose
a response (see the drop-down list) and provide further explanation.

Note that in some cases, certain initial elements of the HIPAA Security
Assessment indicated in Sections 3.05 – 3.07 may be completed during the
negotiation phase based on the offeror’s response to these contractual
requirements.

## Sec. 3.09 Contract Term and Work Schedule

The length of the contract will be from the date of award for eighteen
months, with one additional one-year renewal option to be exercised at
the sole discretion of the state.

Any extension of the contract beyond the exercised renewal options will
be upon mutual agreement between the State and the contractor and
effected with a contract amendment processed by the procurement officer
and signed by both parties. All other terms and conditions of the
contract, including those previously amended, shall remain in full force
and effect. Unless otherwise agreed to by both parties, the procurement
officer will provide written notice to the contractor of the intent to
cancel an extension at least 30 days before the desired date of
cancellation.

## Sec. 3.10 Contract Type

This contract is a firm fixed price contract.

## Sec. 3.11 Payment Procedures

The state will make payments based on a negotiated payment schedule.
Each billing must consist of an invoice and progress report. No payment
will be made until the progress report and invoice has been approved by

costs associated with the contract must be stated in U.S. currency.

Any single contract payment of \$1 million or higher must be accepted by
the contractor via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).

## Sec. 3.13 Location of Work

The location(s) where the work is to be performed, completed, and
managed is at the discretion of the contractor as long as the location
complies with the requirements listed below.

The state will be provided with a limited amount of office space (1-2
desk spaces, co-located with DOH staff during contract specific travel).
The contractor must provide any additional space that is needed.

We anticipate much of this work to be performed remotely with close
collaboration between the project team via digital communication
methods. There may be some occasions where an on-site visit is required,
but those will be the exception rather than the rule. All equipment
(laptops, printers, internet access, etc.) must be supplied by the
contractor and must meet physical and information safeguards as defined
by DOH staff.

Contractor staff must be available to participate in project-related
meetings as scheduled by DOH staff with the State of Alaska’s normal

lodging, and per diem costs sufficient to pay for 2-3 persons to make
2-3 trips to 3601 C Street, Suite 490, Anchorage, Alaska 99503 or to 350
Main Street, Juneau, AK 99811-0640 on rare occasion. Travel to other
locations will not be required.

By signature on their proposal, the offeror certifies that all services
provided under this contract by the contractor and all subcontractors
shall be performed in the United States.

If the offeror cannot certify that all work will be performed in the
United States, the offeror must submit a request, set out in a separate
document in their proposal, that provides a detailed description of the
portion of work that will be performed outside the United States, where,
by whom, and the reason that is necessary.

The offeror must also provide this information when completing the DOH
IT Contractual Requirements Submittal Form.

Failure to comply with these requirements may cause the state to reject
the proposal as non-responsive or cancel the contract.

## Sec. 3.14 Third-Party Service Providers

In the event that the vendor solution includes commercial or hosted/SaaS
solution, the contractor and any subcontractors must provide, on an
annual basis, a Type 2 Statement on Standards for Attestation
Engagements (SSAE) **SOC 2** report(s). Failure to provide these reports
may be treated as a material breach and may be a basis for a finding of
default.

## Sec. 3.15 Subcontractors

Subcontractors may be used to perform work under this contract. If an
offeror intends to use subcontractors, the offeror must complete the
Submittal Form identified in Section 4.02 Submittal Form H of this RFP.

An offeror's failure to provide this information with their proposal may
cause the state to consider their proposal non-responsive and reject it.

Subcontractor experience shall not be considered in determining whether
the offeror meets the requirements set forth in Submittal Form F –
Mandatory Requirements. **Offerors must be specific in Submittal Form F
as to which subcontractor(s) defined in Submittal Form G –
Subcontractors they are citing to meet the specific requirement listed
in Submittal Form F.**

If a proposal with subcontractors is selected, the state may require a
signed written statement from each subcontractor that clearly verifies
the subcontractor is committed to provide the good or services required
by the contract.

The substitution of one subcontractor for another may be made only at
the discretion and prior written approval of the project director or
procurement officer.

Note that if the subcontractor will not be performing work within
Alaska, they will not be required to hold an Alaska business license.

## Sec. 3.16 Joint Ventures

Joint ventures will not be allowed.

contractor's place of business that are related to the performance of a
contract. If the state makes such an inspection, the contractor must
provide reasonable assistance.

## Sec. 3.18 Right of CMS Audit and Inspection

Throughout the life of the contract, the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and its
contractors shall have to the right to conduct onsite or offsite
evaluation of services performed by the contractor and to audit and
inspect contractor information, data, and records. These rights are
addition to Article 2 of Appendix A of this contract, which provides for
Inspections and Reports that may be conducted by the Department of
Health.

## Sec. 3.19 Contract Personnel

Any change of the project team members or subcontractors named in the
proposal must be approved, in advance and in writing, by the project
director or procurement officer. Changes that are not approved by the
state may be grounds for the state to terminate the contract.

DOH envisions the need for the following roles and skillsets as part of
the contractor team:

| **Role** | **Responsibility** |
|------|------|
| Product Manager| Responsible for planning (in accordance with project goals, timelines, and budget), overseeing development (includes resource management), delivery, and deployment of software, and overall communication - keeping stakeholders updated on project progress and seeking their input throughout the project lifecycle. |
| Scrum Master | Responsible for facilitating communication between internal and external groups, agile coaching, leading healthy conflicts, removing impediments, keeping the product backlog up to date, sprint planning, and rituals (stand-ups, review/retro, etc.). |
| Technical Lead | Responsible for technical guidance within the team. A Tech Lead is not a manager; they are a member of the Agile Team and contribute to delivery and provide help and mentorship to their teammates. |
| Developers (Front-end, Back-end, or Full Stack) | Responsible for programming, testing, and debugging the product; this includes estimating, planning, and managing all of his/her own tasks and reporting on progress. |
| Enterprise Content Manager Professional | Responsible for connecting people, processes, and technology together meaningfully (using HP Exstream, or OpenText Exstream or other, if the division migrates to a new enterprise content management system (ECM)). |
| Researcher | Responsible for collecting and organizing feedback into subsequent iterations to support changes in requirements and system dynamics.

## Sec. 3.22 Nondisclosure and Confidentiality

Contractor agrees that all confidential information shall be used only
for purposes of providing the deliverables and performing the services
specified herein and shall not disseminate or allow dissemination of
confidential information except as provided for in this section. The
contractor shall hold as confidential and will use reasonable care
(including both facility physical security and electronic security) to
prevent unauthorized access by, storage, disclosure, publication,
dissemination to and/or use by third parties of, the confidential
information. “Reasonable care” means compliance by the contractor with
all applicable federal and state law, including the Social Security Act
and HIPAA. The contractor must promptly notify the state in writing if
it becomes aware of any storage, disclosure, loss, unauthorized access
to or use of the confidential information.

Confidential information, as used herein, means any data, files,
software, information or materials (whether prepared by the state or its
agents or advisors) in oral, electronic, tangible or intangible form and
however stored, compiled or memorialized that is classified confidential
as defined by State of Alaska classification and categorization
guidelines provided by the state to the contractor or a contractor agent
or otherwise made available to the contractor or a contractor agent in
connection with this contract, or acquired, obtained or learned by the
contractor or a contractor agent in the performance of this contract.

contracting agency from and against any third-party claim of, or
liability for error, omission or negligent act of the contractor under
this agreement. The contractor shall not be required to indemnify the
contracting agency for a claim of, or liability for, the independent
negligence of the contracting agency. If there is a claim of, or
liability for, the joint negligent error or omission of the contractor
and the independent negligence of the contracting agency, the
indemnification and hold harmless obligation shall be apportioned on a
comparative fault basis. “Contractor” and “contracting agency”, as used
within this and the following article, include the employees, agents and
other contractors who are directly responsible, respectively, to each.
The term “independent negligence” is negligence other than in the

## Sec. 3.25 Termination for Default

If the project director or procurement officer determines that the
contractor has refused to perform the work or has failed to perform the
work with such diligence as to ensure its timely and accurate
completion, the state may, by providing written notice to the
contractor, terminate the contractor's right to proceed with part or all
of the remaining work.

The procurement officer may also, by written notice, terminate the
contract under Administrative Order 352 if the contractor supports or
participates in a boycott of the State of Israel.

## Sec. 4.06 Approach to User Interface and User Experience (Submittal Form D)

Background

A User Experience (UX) approach involves a deep understanding of the
users through research, organizing information, visual design (and
more), all with the goal of meeting user needs and doing it elegantly.
It involves putting users at the center of the design and development
process, and establishing an iterative cycle of research, design and
evaluation.

User interface (UI) design is a critical element in developing
captivating, user-friendly applications. Cutting-edge user interface
(UI) design is about more than simply looks; it’s also about enabling a
smooth user experience (UX). This insight has prompted the pursuit of
new frontiers in UI design, wherein technology and creativity combine to
produce interfaces that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also
logically functional.

The concept of user centric design is one of our core development
tenants. The days of using UI design only to create visually appealing,
static screens without considering the user’s journey are long gone. The
user-centric approach of UI design prioritizes understanding the
demands, habits, and frustrations of the user.

Additional concepts to consider include:

- Minimalism: Using only the most necessary components in the design,
  this method concentrates on simplicity to produce a clear and simple
  interface.
- Advanced Technologies: New opportunities for innovation in user
  interface design have been created by the integration of cutting-edge
  technologies like augmented reality (AR), machine learning (ML), and
  artificial intelligence (AI). Designers may make interfaces that are
  more individualized, engaging, and an accessible to a wider range of
  people with varying requirements and skills by utilizing these
  technologies.
- Gesture based Navigation: Due to widespread use of touchscreen
  devices, gesture-based navigation (which uses the user’s gestures to
  engage with software) has become more accessible. This method can
  lessen the user’s cognitive burden and improve the intuitiveness of
  navigation.

Approach

Please succinctly describe how you will perform user experience and user
interface design as a part of the overall user research. Also include
information about how this research will be translated into relevant
user stories and ultimately into working software. DOH, DPA expects that
for any user facing system changes, there will need to be some amount of
user research and design.

SPECIAL NOTE: The offeror shall not disclose their costs in this
Submittal Form. This Submittal Form cannot exceed the page limit (as
described in Section 4.02).

## Sec. 4.07 Product Management Approach (Submittal Form E)

Succinctly describe your approach to the following areas of product
management:

- Product Coordination – Describe how you will manage the necessary
coordination of the different stakeholder groups both within the state
and within your teams. How you will handle team communication, meeting
scheduling, and day to day information sharing. How you plan to
coordinate both the agile ceremonies needed for new work, as well as the
support ticket process with the existing helpdesk team and systems.
- Risk Management – Discuss how the identification, classification,
mitigation, and documentation of risks would be addressed.
- Issue Management – Discuss how issues will be identified, addressed,
or escalated as needed.
- Testing – Describe your philosophy of testing, and how you would work
with the state technical support teams to integrate into the shared
CI/CD pipeline. Describe how you envision incorporating user testing.
- User Research Coordination – Describe an overview of your research

# Section 5. EVALUATION CRITERIA AND CONTRACTOR SELECTION

## Sec. 5.01 Summary of Evaluation Process

The state will use the following steps to evaluate and prioritize
proposals:

1. Proposals will be assessed for overall responsiveness. Proposals deemed non-responsive will be eliminated from further consideration.
2. A proposal evaluation committee (PEC), made up of at least three state employees or public officials, will evaluate specific parts of the responsive proposals.
3. The Submittal Forms, from each responsive proposal, will be sent to
    the PEC. No cost information will be shared or provided to the PEC.
4. The PEC will independently evaluate and score the documents based on
    the degree to which they meet the stated evaluation criteria.
5. After independent scoring, the PEC will have a meeting, chaired by
    the procurement officer, where the PEC may have a group discussion
    prior to finalizing their scores.
6. The evaluators will submit their final individual scores to the
    procurement officer, who will then compile the scores and calculate
    awarded points as set out in Section 5.03.
7. The procurement officer will calculate scores for cost proposals as
    set out in Section 5.08 and add those scores to the awarded points
    along with factoring in any Alaska preferences.
8. The procurement officer may prioritize the proposals, and the state
    may conduct interviews with the top-rated offerors.
9. The PEC will evaluate and score the interviews, and the procurement
    officer will compile the final scores.
10. The state will then conduct any necessary negotiations with the
    highest scoring offeror and award a contract if the negotiations are
    successful.

## Sec. 5.02 Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on their overall value to state,
considering both cost and non-cost factors as described below. Note: An
evaluation may not be based on discrimination due to the race, religion,
color, national origin, sex, age, marital status, pregnancy, parenthood,
disability, or political affiliation of the offeror.

| **Overall Criteria** | **Weight** |
|------|------|
| Responsiveness                             | Pass/Fail |
| Mandatory Requirements Compliance (Submittal Form F) | N/A       |

| **Qualifications Criteria** | **Weight** |

| **Total**                     | **250**   |

**TOTAL EVALUATION POINTS AVAILABLE: 1000**

## Sec. 5.03 Scoring Method and Calculation

The PEC will evaluate responses against the questions set out in
Sections 5.04 through 5.07 and assign a single score for each section.
Offerors’ responses for each section may be rated comparatively against
one another with each PEC member assigning a score of 1, 5, or 10 (with
10 representing the highest score, 5 representing the average score, and
1 representing the lowest score). Responses that are similar or lack
dominant information to differentiate the offerors from each other will
receive the same score. Therefore, it is the offeror’s responsibility to
provide dominant information and differentiate themselves from their
competitors.

After the PEC has scored each section, the scores for each section will
be totaled and the following formula will be used to calculate the
amount of points awarded for that section:

1. Maximum Points Available / Maximum Combined PEC Score Possible
2. Combined PEC Score x Result of 1)

**Example (Maximum Points Available for the Section = 100):**

| **Offeror**   | **PEC Member 1 Score** | **PEC Member 2 Score** | **PEC Member 3 Score** | **PEC Member 4 Score** | **Combined Total Score** | **Points Awarded** |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Offeror 1     | 10                     | 5                      | 5                      | 10                     | 30                       | 75                 |
| Offeror 2     | 5                      | 5                      | 5                      | 5                      | 20                       | 50                 |

## Sec. 5.04 Experience and Qualifications

Offerors must provide an organizational chart specific to the personnel
assigned to accomplish the work called for in this RFP; illustrate the
lines of authority; designate the individual responsible and accountable
for the completion of each component and deliverable of the RFP.

Offerors must provide a proposed staffing plan. It should include the
following: narrative description of the organization of the project team
and a personnel roster that identifies each person who will actually
work on the contract and provide the following information about each
person listed:

- Narrative description of the organization of the project team;
- Personnel roster that identifies each person who will work on the
  project to include their role
- Identify key staff and their level of allocation to the project;
- Provide resumes for key staff

Key Staff should include the offeror’s Project and Deputy Manager, Lead
Technical Manager, Business Manager, Lead Business Analyst, and all
business analysts, implementation team members and team leader, and
integration architect.

It would be highly desirable for members of the offeror’s key staff to
have prior or current experience working with the Department.

Offerors must provide reference names and phone numbers for similar
projects the offeror’s firm has completed to include contract value and
a brief description of the eligibility system projects that were
successfully completed.

The offeror’s project manager should have the following:

- A current Project Management Institute (PMI) Project Management
  Professional (PMP) certification or equivalent recognized project
  management certification (not a certificate for the completion of a
  project management course); and
- Served as the project manager or key staff member on an eligibility
  system implementation project within the previous three years for a
  system that is still in operation/production.
- The Offeror should provide a copy of the project manager’s credentials

The State will evaluate the offeror's proposed staffing model, skill
levels, labor categories, allocation, and relevant work experience
demonstrated by Key Personnel.

The State will evaluate the offeror’s experience in performing work of
similar scope and complexity. The State will also evaluate the offeror’s
experience with similar technology, software development and related
development methodology, human-centered design, and continuous
deployment methods.

This Submittal Form must not exceed ten pages (reference RFP section
4.02); however, resumes and letters of intent are not included in the
page limitation and may be submitted as attachments.

## Sec. 5.05 Technical Understanding and Approach

The State will evaluate the offeror’s technical approach: level of
knowledge, technical expertise, and overall understanding of the
requirements. The State will also evaluate the offeror’s skills with
similar technology software development and continuous deployment
methods. Of special note is how well the proposed approach aligns with
the Department’s Technical Strategy.

## Sec. 5.06 Product Management Approach

The State will evaluate the offeror’s approach to project coordination,
risk management, issue management, user testing, and user research
coordination.

## Sec. 5.07 Approach to User Interface and User Experience

The State will evaluate the offeror’s approach to user interface and
user experience as they relate to the creation of user stories and
delivery of working software.

## Sec. 5.08 Contract Cost (Cost Proposal)

Overall, a minimum of **25**% of the total evaluation points will be
assigned to cost. The offeror with the lowest total cost will receive
the maximum number of points allocated to cost per 2 AAC 12.260(c). The
point allocations for cost on the other proposals will be determined
using the following formula:

*\[(Price of Lowest Cost Proposal) x (Maximum Points for Cost)\] ÷ (Cost
of Each Higher Priced Proposal)*

**Example (Max Points for Contract Cost = 400):**

**Step 1**

List all proposal prices, adjusted where appropriate by the application
of applicable preferences claimed by the offeror.

Offeror \#1 \$40,000  
Offeror \#2 \$42,750  
Offeror \#3 \$47,500

**Step 2**

In this example, the RFP allotted 40% of the available 1,000 points to
cost. This means that the lowest cost will receive the maximum number of
points.

**Offeror \#1 receives 400 points.**

The reason they receive that amount is because the lowest cost proposal,
in this case \$40,000, receives the maximum number of points allocated
to cost, 400 points.

**Offeror \#2 receives 374.3 points.**

*\$40,000 lowest cost x 400 maximum points for cost = 16,000,000 ÷
\$42,750 cost of Offeror \#2’s proposal = **374.3***

**Offeror \#3 receives 336.8 points.**

*\$40,000 lowest cost x 400 maximum points for cost = 16,000,000 ÷
\$47,500 cost of Offeror \#3’s proposal* = **336.8**

## Sec. 5.09 Shortlisting

After proposals have been prioritized, the state may shortlist and
interview the top three highest ranking offerors. The state may increase
or decrease the number of offerors in this list based on the
competitiveness of the proposals and/or from feedback from the PEC.

## Sec. 5.10 Interviews of Critical Team Members

The state may conduct an individual interview with the primary project
manager and a group interview with the critical team members identified
in Submittal Form A of the offeror’s proposal (the state reserves the
right to request additional personnel). All these personnel must attend
the interview, and no other individuals from the offeror’s organization
will be allowed to sit in or participate during the interview sessions.
If any of these personnel fail to attend the interview the offeror may
be given a “1” score, which may jeopardize the offeror’s
competitiveness.

Interviews are expected to last approximately 100 minutes, but that time
may be increased or decreased at the discretion of the state.
Interviewees may not bring notes, presentation materials, or handouts.
Interviewees may be prohibited from making any reference to their
proposed cost/fees.

Below is an example of the schedule the interviews will follow:

| **No.** | **Agenda Item** | **Time Allocated**      |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 1       | Introductions   | Approximately 5 minutes |
| 2       | Open Session    | 90 minutes              |
| 3       | Closing Remarks | 5 minutes               |

Introductions will be used solely for introducing team member’s names
and roles on both the State and offeror’s side. Time for introductions
will not be allocated to business development purposes.

During the open technical session, the offeror will respond to the
State’s questions related to the technical aspects of the offeror’s
proposal. The goal of the open session is to assess the abilities and
understanding of the proposed Key Personnel, and to further elaborate on
the proposed approach described in the written proposal. The State
strongly prefers a demonstration of a similar application built on like
technology. This application can be a working prototype if a production
application is not available for demo. This could include a short
overview of an application that is built in JAVA and running on IBM
WebSphere that includes a rules-based system or changes to an
application that is already running on a similar technology stack. Of
special note would be a demonstration of code management processes where
multiple teams are working on a single code base including tools,
testing, and process control. The State is not interested in a demo or
overview of an eligibility system that does not share similar technology
and does not demonstrate the team’s ability to modify and maintain the
State of Alaska’s Integrated Eligibility System. At this time the State
of Alaska is not interested in a full system replacement and does not
intend to issue an RFP to do so.

Proposed Key Personnel must participate in the verbal presentation.
Otherwise, the offeror will be considered non-responsive and excluded
from further consideration. The State is most interested in hearing from
staff who will have a direct role in completing the tasks.

Verbal presentations will take place via Microsoft Teams video chat. The
State will coordinate and set up the meeting accordingly. We strongly
encourage you join with audio, video, and screen sharing capability.

The open session will not exceed 90 minutes. The Procurement Officer
will strictly enforce this time limit on all presentations.

There will be no follow-up session for further questions after the
presentation.

Interviewees may be asked questions regarding their experience,
knowledge and understanding of the scope of work, obstacles and
challenges, strategies, and their plan/approach. The state may request
additional information prior to interviews. The PEC will score each
interview individually using the 1, 5, 10 scoring method described in
Section 5.03, and may have a group discussion prior to finalizing
scores.

## Sec. 5.11 Cost Reasonableness

Prior to conducting contract negotiations, the procurement officer may
perform a cost reasonableness assessment of proposals in the following
manner:

1. If the highest ranked offeror’s cost proposal is within 5% of the
    next highest ranked offeror’s cost proposal, the state may proceed
    to invite the highest ranked offeror to contract negotiations.
2. If the highest ranked offeror’s cost proposal is 5% or more higher
    than the next highest ranked offeror’s cost proposal, the state
    reserves the right to invite the second highest ranked offeror to
    contract negotiations.

## Sec. 5.12 Contract Negotiations

After final evaluation, the procurement officer may negotiate with the
offeror of the highest or second highest ranked proposal. The intent of
negotiations is to allow the apparent best-value offeror an opportunity
to clarify and document any assumptions, issues, or risks, and confirm
that their proposal is accurate. It is also to allow the state to do the
same, including the offeror’s response to the DOT IT Contractual
Requirements.

Negotiations, if held, shall be within the scope of the request for
proposals and limited to those items which would not have an effect on
the ranking of proposals. The state reserves the right at its sole
discretion to negotiate with the potential best-value offeror during the
negotiation period. This may include, but is not limited to, modifying
the scope of the project (time, cost, quality, expectations, etc.).
However, modifications may not be made to the extent it would have an
effect on the ranking of proposals.

An invitation to the negotiation period does not constitute a legally
binding offer to enter into a contract on the part of the state or the
offeror. If at any time during the negotiation period, if the state is
not satisfied with the progress being made by the selected offeror, or
if the offeror:

- fails to provide the information required to begin negotiations in a
  timely manner;
- fails to negotiate in good faith;
- indicates they cannot perform the contract within the budgeted funds
  available for the project; or
- if the offeror and the state, after a good faith effort, simply cannot
  come to terms,

The state may terminate negotiations with the offeror initially selected
and commence negotiations with an alternative offeror.

## Sec. 5.13 Offeror Notification of Selection

After the completion of contract negotiation, the procurement officer
will issue a written Notice of Intent to Award and send copies of that
notice to all offerors who submitted proposals. The notice will list the
names of all offerors and identify the offeror(s) selected for award.

# Section 6. GENERAL PROCESS AND LEGAL INFORMATION

## Sec 6.01 Informal Debriefing

When the contract is completed, an informal debriefing may be performed
at the discretion of the project director or procurement officer. If
performed, the scope of the debriefing will be limited to the work
performed by the contractor.

## Sec. 6.02 Alaska Business License and Other Required Licenses

Prior to the award of a contract, an offeror must hold a valid Alaska
business license. However, in order to receive the Alaska Bidder
Preference and other related preferences, such as the Alaska Veteran
Preference and Alaska Offeror Preference, an offeror must hold a valid
Alaska business license prior to the deadline for receipt of proposals.
Offerors should contact the **Department of Commerce, Community and
Economic Development, Division of Corporations, Business, and
Professional Licensing** for information on these licenses. Acceptable
evidence that the offeror possesses a valid Alaska business license may
consist of any one of the following:

- copy of an Alaska business license;
- certification on the proposal that the offeror has a valid Alaska
  business license and has included the license number in the proposal;
- a canceled check for the Alaska business license fee;
- a copy of the Alaska business license application with a receipt stamp
  from the state's occupational licensing office; or
- a sworn and notarized statement that the offeror has applied and paid
  for the Alaska business license.

You are not required to hold a valid Alaska business license at the time
proposals are opened if you possess one of the following licenses and
are offering services or supplies under that specific line of business:

- fisheries business licenses issued by Alaska Department of Revenue or
  Alaska Department of Fish and Game,
- liquor licenses issued by Alaska Department of Revenue for alcohol
  sales only,
- insurance licenses issued by Alaska Department of Commerce, Community
  and Economic Development, Division of Insurance, or
- Mining licenses issued by Alaska Department of Revenue.

Prior the deadline for receipt of proposals, all offerors must hold any
other necessary applicable professional licenses required by Alaska
Statute.

## Sec. 6.03 Standard Contract Provisions

The contractor will be required to sign the state's Standard Agreement
Form for Professional Services. This form is attached with the RFP for
your review. The contractor must comply with the Appendix A contract
provisions set out in this attachment. No alteration of these provisions
will be permitted without prior written approval from the Department of
Law, and the state reserves the right to reject a proposal that is
non-compliant or takes exception with the contract terms and conditions
stated in the Agreement. Any requests to change language in this
document (adjust, modify, add, delete, etc.), must be set out in the
offeror’s proposal in a separate document. Please include the following
information with any change that you are proposing:

1. Identify the provision that the offeror takes exception with.
2. Identify why the provision is unjust, unreasonable, etc.
3. Identify exactly what suggested changes should be made.

## Sec. 6.04 Business Associate Agreement (BAA)

The State has a standard BAA that is included in contracts that involve
Personal Health Information (PHI) covered under the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Act. This BAA will be included in
the fully executed contract and is attached along with this RFP as HIPAA
BAA. Similar to Section 6.03, any request to change language in this
document must be set out in the offeror’s proposal in a separate
document.

## Sec. 6.05 Qualified Offerors

Per 2 AAC 12.875, unless provided for otherwise in the RFP, to qualify
as an offeror for award of a contract issued under AS 36.30, the offeror
must:

1. Add value in the contract by actually performing, controlling,
    managing, or supervising the services to be provided; or
2. Be in the business of selling and have actually sold on a regular
    basis the supplies that are the subject of the RFP.

If the offeror leases services or supplies or acts as a broker or agency
in providing the services or supplies in order to meet these
requirements, the procurement officer may not accept the offeror as a
qualified offeror under AS 36.30.

## Sec. 6.06 Proposal as Part of the Contract

Part of all of this RFP and the successful proposal may be incorporated
into the contract.

## Sec. 6.07 Additional Terms and Conditions

The state reserves the right to add terms and conditions during contract
negotiations. These terms and conditions will be within the scope of the
RFP and will not affect the proposal evaluations.

## Sec. 6.08 Human Trafficking

By signature on their proposal, the offeror certifies that the offeror
is not established and headquartered or incorporated and headquartered
in a country recognized as Tier 3 in the most recent United States
Department of State’s Trafficking in Persons Report.

The most recent United States Department of State’s Trafficking in
Persons Report can be found at the following website:
<https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/>

Failure to comply with this requirement will cause the state to reject
the proposal as non-responsive or cancel the contract.

## Sec. 6.09 Right of Rejection

Offerors must comply with all of the terms of the RFP, the State
Procurement Code (AS 36.30), and all applicable local, state, and
federal laws, codes, and regulations. The procurement officer may reject
any proposal that does not comply with all of the material and
substantial terms, conditions, and performance requirements of the RFP.

Offerors may not qualify the proposal nor restrict the rights of the
state. If an offeror does so, the procurement officer may determine the
proposal to be a non-responsive counter-offer and the proposal may be
rejected.

Minor informalities that:

- do not affect responsiveness; 
- are merely a matter of form or format;
- do not change the relative standing or otherwise prejudice other offers;
- do not change the meaning or scope of the RFP;
- are trivial, negligible, or immaterial in nature;
- do not reflect a material change in the work; or
- do not constitute a substantial reservation against a requirement or provision;

may be waived by the procurement officer.

The state reserves the right to refrain from making an award if it
determines that to be in its best interest. **A proposal from a debarred
or suspended offeror shall be rejected.**

## Sec. 6.10 State Not Responsible for Preparation Costs

The state will not pay any cost associated with the preparation,
submittal, presentation, or evaluation of any proposal.

## Sec. 6.11 Disclosure of Proposal Contents

All proposals and other material submitted become the property of the
State of Alaska and may be returned only at the state's option. AS
40.25.110 requires public records to be open to reasonable inspection.
All proposal information, including detailed price and cost information,
will be held in confidence during the evaluation process and prior to
the time a Notice of Intent to Award is issued. Thereafter, proposals
will become public information.

Trade secrets and other proprietary data contained in proposals may be
held confidential if the offeror requests, in writing, that the
procurement officer does so, and if the procurement officer agrees, in
writing, to do so. The offeror’s request must be included with the
proposal, must clearly identify the information they wish to be held
confidential, and include a statement that sets out the reasons for
confidentiality. Unless the procurement officer agrees in writing to
hold the requested information confidential, that information will also
become public after the Notice of Intent to Award is issued.

## Sec. 6.12 Assignment

Per 2 AAC 12.480, the contractor may not transfer or assign any portion
of the contract without prior written approval from the procurement
officer. Proposals that are conditioned upon the state’s approval of an
assignment will be rejected as non-responsive.

## Sec. 6.13 Severability

If any provision of the contract or agreement is declared by a court to
be illegal or in conflict with any law, the validity of the remaining
terms and provisions will not be affected; and, the rights and
obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced as if the
contract did not contain the particular provision held to be invalid.

## Sec. 6.14 Supplemental Terms and Conditions

Proposals must comply with Section 6.08 Right of Rejection. However, if
the state fails to identify or detect supplemental terms or conditions
that conflict with those contained in this RFP or that diminish the
state's rights under any contract resulting from the RFP, the term(s) or
condition(s) will be considered null and void. After award of contract:

If conflict arises between a supplemental term or condition included in
the proposal and a term or condition of the RFP, the term or condition
of the RFP will prevail; and

If the state's rights would be diminished as a result of application of
a supplemental term or condition included in the proposal, the
supplemental term or condition will be considered null and void.

## Sec. 6.15 Solicitation Advertising

Public notice has been provided in accordance with 2 AAC 12.220.

## Sec. 6.16 Site Inspection

The state may conduct on-site visits to evaluate the offeror's capacity
to perform the contract. An offeror must agree, at risk of being found
non-responsive and having its proposal rejected, to provide the state
reasonable access to relevant portions of its work sites. Individuals
designated by the procurement officer at the state’s expense will make
site inspection.

## Sec. 6.17 Clarification of Offers

In order to determine if a proposal is reasonably susceptible for
award, communications by the procurement officer or the proposal
evaluation committee (PEC) are permitted with an offeror to clarify
uncertainties or eliminate confusion concerning the contents of a
proposal. Clarifications may not result in a material or substantive
change to the proposal. The evaluation by the procurement officer or the
PEC may be adjusted as a result of a clarification under this section.

## Sec. 6.18 Discussions with Offerors

The state may conduct discussions with offerors in accordance with AS
36.30.240 and 2 AAC 12.290. The purpose of these discussions will be to
ensure full understanding of the requirements of the RFP and proposal.
Discussions will be limited to specific sections of the RFP or proposal
identified by the procurement officer. Discussions will only be held
with offerors who have submitted a proposal deemed reasonably
susceptible for award by the procurement officer. Discussions, if held,
will be after initial evaluation of proposals by the procurement officer
or the PEC. If modifications are made as a result of these discussions
they will be put in writing. Following discussions, the procurement
officer may set a time for best and final proposal submissions from
those offerors with whom discussions were held. Proposals may be
reevaluated after receipt of best and final proposal submissions.

If an offeror does not submit a best and final proposal or a notice of
withdrawal, the offeror’s immediate previous proposal is considered the
offeror’s best and final proposal.

Offerors with a disability needing accommodation should contact the
procurement officer prior to the date set for discussions so that
reasonable accommodation can be made. Any oral modification of a
proposal must be reduced to writing by the offeror.

## Sec. 6.19 Federally Imposed Tariffs

Changes in price (increase or decrease) resulting directly from a new or
updated federal tariff, excise tax, or duty, imposed after contract
award may be adjusted during the contract period or before delivery into
the United States via contract amendment.
- **Notification of Changes:** The contractor must promptly notify the
  procurement officer in writing of any new, increased, or decreased
  federal excise tax or duty that may result in either an increase or
  decrease in the contact price and shall take appropriate action as
  directed by the procurement officer.
- **After-imposed or Increased Taxes and Duties:** Any federal excise
  tax or duty for goods or services covered by this contract that was
  exempted or excluded on the contract award date but later imposed on
  the contractor during the contract period, as the result of
  legislative, judicial, or administrative action may result in a price
  increase provided:
	
1. The tax or duty takes effect after the contract award date and
      isn’t otherwise addressed by the contract;
2. The contractor warrants, in writing, that no amount of the newly
      imposed federal excise tax or duty or rate increase was included
      in the contract price, as a contingency or otherwise.

- **After-relieved or Decreased Taxes and Duties:** The contract price
  shall be decreased by the amount of any decrease in federal excise tax
  or duty for goods or services under the contract, except social
  security or other employment
  [taxes](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=e7c3de2c69ecf724736be4cfdf5433ce&term_occur=7&term_src=Title:48:Chapter:1:Subchapter:H:Part:52:Subpart:52.2:52.229-3),
  that the contractor is required to pay or bear, or does not obtain a
  refund of, through the contractor's fault, negligence, or failure to
  follow instructions of the procurement officer.
- **State’s Ability to Make Changes:** The state reserves the right to
  request verification of federal excise tax or duty amounts on goods or
  services covered by this contract and increase or decrease the
  contract price accordingly.
- **Price Change Threshold:** No adjustment shall be made in the
  contract price under this clause unless the amount of the adjustment
  exceeds \$250.

## Sec. 6.20 Protest

AS 36.30.560 provides that an interested party may protest the content
of the RFP.

An interested party is defined in 2 AAC 12.990(a) (7) as "an actual or
prospective bidder or offeror whose economic interest might be affected
substantially and directly by the issuance of a contract solicitation,
the award of a contract, or the failure to award a contract."

If an interested party wishes to protest the content of a solicitation,
the protest must be received, in writing, by the procurement officer at
least ten days prior to the deadline for receipt of proposals.

AS 36.30.560 also provides that an interested party may protest the
award of a contract or the proposed award of a contract.

If an offeror wishes to protest the award of a contract or the proposed
award of a contract, the protest must be received, in writing, by the
procurement officer within ten days after the date the Notice of Intent
to Award the contract is issued.

A protester must have submitted a proposal in order to have sufficient
standing to protest the proposed award of a contract. Protests must
include the following information:

- the name, address, and telephone number of the protester;
- the signature of the protester or the protester's representative;
- identification of the contracting agency and the solicitation or
  contract at issue;
- a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds of the protest
  including copies of relevant documents; and the form of relief
  requested.

The procurement officer will issue a written response to the protest.
The response will set out the procurement officer's decision and contain
the basis of the decision within the statutory time limit in AS
36.30.580. A copy of the decision will be furnished to the protester by
certified mail, fax or another method that provides evidence of receipt.

All offerors will be notified of any protest. The review of protests,
decisions of the procurement officer, appeals, and hearings, will be
conducted in accordance with the State Procurement Code (AS 36.30),
Article 8 "Legal and Contractual Remedies.”
